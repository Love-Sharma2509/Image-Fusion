# Image-Fusion
An image, digital image, or still image is a binary representation of visual information, such as drawings, pictures, graphs, logos, or individual video frames. Image is a spatial representation of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional scene. It is an array or a matrix of pixels arranged in columns and rows. Pixel Matrix is used to present images on the computer. Each pixel of such an image is presented by one matrix element â€“ an integer from the set. The numeric values in pixel presentation are uniformly changed from zero (black pixels) to 255 (White pixels)

Images are helpful in extracting information for any particular situation but it may be possible that the image does not provide the exact information we need. So, we use multiple images to extract the required information. Instead of storing many images to extract data we use Image Fusion to get a resulting fused image that can provide us with the whole information.

Goals of Image Fusion

    Image Sharpening
    Feature Enhancement
    Improved Classification

Advantages Of Image Fusion
    
    Easiest to interpret
    Has a high resolution used at multiscale images
    enhances the image with all perspectives of images
    reduce data storage and data transmission
    best for identification and recognition

Image Fusion can be done in many ways. But we are going to perform Multi focus Image fusion.

Multi-Focus Image Fusion (MFIF) is a method that combines two or more source images to obtain a single image that is focused, has improved quality and more information than the source images. Due to the limited Depth-of-Field of the imagining system, extracting all the useful information from a single image is challenging. Thus two or more defocused source images are fused together to obtain a composite image.
